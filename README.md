# Hip-Hop-Web
There's a bunch of different weird connections and features in hip-hop.  Kanye West and MF DOOM have a distance of 2, with a common edge between MadLib.  This project is an attempt to visualize this Hip-Hop Web and eventually automate it for many artists.
This first graph is created with BFS.  BFS will show closer relations to the artist.

This graph was created using DFS.  DFS will show some "weirder" relations to the artist.
